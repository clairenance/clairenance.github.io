Scouse is reported to be part of a group of dialects in the north of the UK where rising contours in declaratives are a traditional aspect of the dialect. This intonation is typologically unusual and has not been the subject of detailed previous research. Here, we present such an analysis in comparison with Manchester, a city less than 40 miles from Liverpool but with a noticeably different prosody. Our analysis confirms reports that rising contours are the most common realization for declaratives in Liverpool, specifically a low rise where final high pitch is not reached until the end of the phrase. Secondly, we consider the origin of declarative rises in Scouse with reference to the literature on new dialect formation. Our demographic analysis and review of previous work on relevant dialects suggests that declarative rises were not the majority variant when Scouse was formed but may have been adopted for facilitating communication in a diverse new community. We highlight this contribution of intonational data to research on phonological aspects of new dialect formation, which have largely considered segmental phonology or timing previously.","tags":null,"title":"Intonational Variation in the North-West of England, The Origins of a Rising Contour in Liverpool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Dominic Moran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"1df6a2355f2c48ee402b52af67d135a5","permalink":"/publication/2022ijb/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022ijb/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper firstly aims to examine how young Gaelic-English bilinguals in immersion education produce aspects of Gaelic phonology.

Thirdly, we investigate how young new speakers outside of a traditional community negotiate place identity and authenticity.  Our methodology firstly consists of quantitative acoustic and auditory phonetic analysis of word list production data, accompanied by mixed effects regression. Secondly, we employ qualitative analysis of interview data from the same participants. Data are presented from 22 speakers aged 13-14 in Gaelic Medium Education in Glasgow and 15 speakers aged 13-14 in GME on the Isle of Lewis. For comparison with a traditional dialect, we also include 3 speakers from Lewis aged 65-80. Our quantitative analysis considers 3605 tokens in total and the qualitative analysis considers interview data with all speakers. Our finding show that young speakers reproduce traditional aspects of Gaelic phonology, though generally to a lesser extent that older speakers. Young new speakers in Glasgow recognise that they do not speak a traditional dialect of the language. They are beginning to create a new authenticity associated with belonging to Glasgow, which represents a new acquisition setting. This study is the first to explore acquisition of dialect and phonology among young new speakers of Gaelic. We explore perceptions of dialect and the implications of not coming from a traditional Gaelic-speaking area for the first time in young people. Revitalisation settings can lead to successful language acquisition but may also contribute to dialect levelling. However, institutional support structures can lead to increased confidence and new place identities emerging in young speakers.","tags":null,"title":"Place identity and authenticity in minority language revitalisation, Scottish Gaelic in Glasgow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Kirkham","Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"c63580f8323c36ca3f08806fa373a2e9","permalink":"/publication/2022jp/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022jp/","section":"publication","summary":"This article aims to understand the development of diachronic asymmetries in phonological systems by evaluating the variability stability of synchronic contrasts. We focus on sonorant systems involving secondary palatalisation, grounded in the claim that palatalised laterals are more common than palatalised rhotics cross-linguistically. Our analysis reports acoustic and articulatory data on Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language with a large sonorant inventory contrasting palatalised, plain and velarised phonemes across laterals, nasals and rhotics. We summarise high-dimensional dynamic characteristics of the acoustic spectrum and midsagittal tongue shape using a two-stage data reduction process and use these coefficients as inputs for training a Support Vector Machine. This trained model classifies unseen data in terms of its phonemic identity, which reveals that rhotics are classified best word-initially and worst word-finally, with nasals always classified better than laterals. We find that dynamic information substantially improves acoustic classification, but only improves articulatory classification for some sonorants. We propose that the variable synchronic stability of palatalisation contrasts complicates potential trajectories of diachronic change in Gaelic.","tags":null,"title":"Diachronic phonological asymmetries and the variable stability of synchronic contrast","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Sam Kirkham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"25e31f016a738435dea0bbcb88ee7c19","permalink":"/publication/2022l/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022l/","section":"publication","summary":"Much progress has been made in the last 200 years about understanding the origins and mechanisms of sound change. It is hypothesised that many sound changes originate in biomechanical constraints on speech production, or in the misperception of sounds. These production and perception pressures explain a wide range of sound changes across the world's languages, yet we also know that sound change is not inevitable. For example, similar phonological structures have undergone change in many languages yet remained stable in others. In this study, we examine how typologically unusual contrasts are maintained in the face of intense pressures, in order to uncover the potential biomechanical, perceptual and sociolinguistic factors that facilitate the maintenance of typologically unusual contrasts. We focus on secondary articulation contrasts in Scottish Gaelic rhotics, triangulating auditory, acoustic and articulatory data in order to better understand the maintenance of contrast in the face of multi-dimensional typological challenges. Here, individual-level articulatory strategies are combined with contextual prosodic information in order to maintain acoustic and auditory distinctiveness across three rhotic phonemes. We highlight the need to more comprehensively consider typologically unusual and minority languages in order to test the limits of generalisations about cross-linguistic phonetic typology.","tags":null,"title":"Phonetic typology and articulatory constraints, The realisation of secondary articulations in Scottish Gaelic rhotics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"87edc9b2867eb00cefe444eae881e609","permalink":"/publication/2022lv/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022lv/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers the typical focus of analysis in a sound change study across generations, the speech community. I argue that changes in social practices across generations may mean that comparisons across generations can be problematic, and these issues are particularly pertinent in small and endangered language communities. Using data from Scottish Gaelic (Celtic, ISO = gla), a minority endangered language of Scotland, I exemplify the challenges posed by the speech community construct via an examination of lateral production in subsequent generations of speakers. Gaelic traditionally contrasts three phonemic laterals, but analysis shows that this might be changing. There are two possible directions for sound change in the Gaelic lateral system, results show that younger speakers produce some palatalised laterals as palatal glides without laterality. Meanwhile, the remaining laterals are less acoustically distinct among younger generations suggesting the possibility of future merger. While there are differences among the groups of speakers, I argue it is potentially problematic to consider this to be a form of sound change due to differences in social practices among generations surrounding Gaelic usage and socialisation. Ultimately, I advocate for a socially-informed approach to sound change study to sympathetically take into account local social structure.","tags":null,"title":"Sound change or community change?

The analysis considers the use of Scottish Gaelic and the extent of its transmission, drawing largely upon quantitative survey-based data collected from people in the north-west of Scotland - including the Western Isles, Staffin (north Skye) and Tiree. Since the research was conducted under the banner of Soillse, a government-funded sociolinguistics research network for Scottish Gaelic, the team had access to support from relevant councils and schools. This facilitated community buy-in to their work. The overall message here is that community use and transmission of Gaelic in the area studied are very limited, and that analysis of census data alone may paint an overly optimistic picture. The book concludes with some recommendations for a sea-change in policy and the creation of a community trust for Gaelic. It has received much attention in the media in Scotland (and beyond), and has sparked lively debate in the Gaelic-speaking community and the Scottish political sphere.","tags":null,"title":"Review of 'The Gaelic crisis in the vernacular community, A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic'","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"d0ac094b7f7aa1e589bfa712e6f34cb6","permalink":"/publication/2021jslx/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021jslx/","section":"publication","summary":"This review considers the revitalisation programme for Scottish Gaelic (referred to simply as `Gaelic' [galik] by its speakers) which has gathered pace since the 1980s. Gaelic is a minority Celtic language with approximately 58,000 speakers in Scotland (Scottish Government, 2015) and 1,500 speakers in Canada (Statistique Canada, 2016). Gaelic in Scotland developed from the Old Irish spoken by people moving back and forth between Ireland and Scotland in the 4th-5th centuries and eventually became the language spoken across almost all of Scotland in the high medieval era (11th-12th centuries). Since this time, language shift has been taking place in Scotland and locations where the majority of the population speak Gaelic are now confined to north and west Highland areas such as the Western Isles (Outer Hebrides). Frequent waves of migration from Scotland have led to diasporic populations of Gaelic speakers including the substantial settlements in Nova Scotia, Canada, where many Gaelic speakers emigrated in the late18th and early 19th centuries.","tags":null,"title":"Scottish Gaelic revitalisation, Progress and aspiration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Gaelic sonorants are reported to take part in a typologically unusual three-way palatal- isation contrast. Here, the acoustic evidence for this contrast is considered, comparing lateral and nasal consonants in both word-initial and word-final position. Previous acoustic work has considered lateral consonants, but nasals are much less well-described. An acoustic analysis of twelve Gaelic-dominant speakers resident in a traditionally Gaelic-speaking community is reported. Sonorant quality is quantified via measurements of F2-F1 and F3-F2 and observation of the whole spectrum. Additionally, we quantify extensive devoicing in word-final laterals that has not been previously reported. Mixed-effects regression modelling suggests robust three-way acoustic differences in lateral consonants in all relevant vowel contexts. Nasal consonants, however, display lesser evidence of the three-way contrast in formant values and across the spectrum. Potential reasons for lesser evidence of contrast in the nasal system are discussed, including the nature of nasal acoustics, evidence from historical changes, and comparison to other Goidelic dialects.

Acoustic analysis was performed on Gaelic and English speech data collected from children in Gaelic Medium Education in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Word list data were collected from 18 children aged 7‚Äì11 and analyzed using measurements of formants and duration of stop phases. Half of the sample had little or no exposure to Gaelic in the home, while the other half had differing degrees of family input. Statistical analysis was conducted using Conditional Inference Trees. This study finds that any initial differences between children who enter Gaelic Medium Education as fluent speakers and those who do not are leveled out by late primary school, at least in terms of pronunciation. I suggest that leveled varieties of minority languages can develop in pre-adolescence in peer group settings such as minority language education. This study is the first to examine phonetic and phonological acquisition in Gaelic- English bilingual children. It is one of a small number of studies to examine bilingual phonological acquisition in immersion schooling. The study supports recent research exploring the development of peer group varieties among young minority language speakers. This research aims to expand traditional models that consider the extent of exposure to two languages as key in predicting phonetic and phonological production. I suggest that the impact of the peer group and the context of language use are also significant factors. Results suggest potential development of education varieties of Gaelic. These findings have implications for future revitalization strategies for minority languages across the world.","tags":null,"title":"Bilingual language exposure and the peer group, Acquiring phonetics and phonology in Gaelic Medium Education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Roibeard √ì Maolalaigh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"9bfd16f1c8e93f1bbf762f383068a3c2","permalink":"/publication/2019jipa/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019jipa/","section":"publication","summary":"Scottish Gaelic is a minority language of Scotland spoken by approximately 58,000 people, or 1% of the Scottish population (speaker numbers from the 2011 Census available in National Records of Scotland 2015).","tags":null,"title":"Scottish Gaelic","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Generalized additive mixed-models (GAMMs) are used for quantifying time-varying formant data, which allows the modelling of non-linearities in acoustic time series while simultaneously modelling speaker and word level variability in the data. These models are compared to single time-point analyses of lateral and vowel targets in order to determine what ana- lysing formant dynamics can tell about dialect variation in speech acoustics. The results show that lateral targets exhibit robust differences between some positional contexts and also between dia- lects, with smaller differences present in vowel targets. The time-varying analysis shows that dia- lect differences frequently occur globally across the lateral and adjacent vowels. These results suggest a complex relationship between lateral and vowel targets and their coarticulatory dynamics, which problematizes straightforward claims about the realization of laterals and their adjacent vow- els. These findings are further discussed in terms of hypotheses about positional and sociophonetic variation. In doing so, the utility of GAMMs for analysing time-varying multi-segmental acoustic signals is demonstrated, and the significance of the results for accounts of English lateral typology is highlighted.","tags":null,"title":"Dialect variation in formant dynamics, The acoustics of lateral and vowel sequences in Manchester and Liverpool English","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"4bcf09c1a3d67febbd9e8b3b0abd438a","permalink":"/publication/2018ns/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018ns/","section":"publication","summary":"An increasingly wide body of literature has examined the ideological practices surrounding new speakers, and attitudes to their varieties (for example Puigdevall 2014, O'Rourke, Pujolar and Ramallo 2015, O'Rourke and Pujolar 2015). Less studied, however are the linguistic forms used by new speakers. A central aim of the new speaker model is to move away conceptually from the notions of deficiency implied by such terms as `non-native', `second language' and `learner' (O'Rourke and Ramallo 2013, 56). Much of the previous work on new speakers has considered this aim from the perspective of qualitative examinations of power distribution. Another potential angle is to quantitatively investigate the linguistic forms used by new speakers. In doing so I aim to demonstrate that while the linguistic behaviour of new speakers may be different to traditional forms of the language, it has its own internal consistency, and can be considered as innovative rather than deficient. Specifically, this chapter considers how linguistic forms used by new adolescent Scottish Gaelic speakers in Glasgow are innovative compared to traditional varieties of Gaelic, and the extent to which we can consider new speaker varieties as new dialects of minority languages.","tags":null,"title":"Linguistic innovation among Glasgow Gaelic new speakers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Kirkham","Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"e0305916c9789f7cbc4783086f1e8d89","permalink":"/publication/2017jp/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017jp/","section":"publication","summary":"This article investigates the acoustic and articulatory correlates of vowel contrasts in bilingual speakers. We analyse data from bilingual speakers of Twi (Akan) and Ghanaian English, with the aim of examining how the production of the advanced tongue root vowel contrast in Twi relates to the production of the tense/lax vowel contrast in Ghanaian English. These data are compared to tense/lax vowel data from monolingual British English speakers. The acoustic results show that Twi and Ghanaian English mainly rely on F1 for distinguishing [ATR] and [TENSE] vowels, whereas British English uses F1, F2, F3 and duration for the [TENSE] contrast. The ultrasound tongue imaging data show tongue root distinctions across all languages, while there are consistent tongue height distinc- tions in British English, no height distinctions in Ghanaian English, and small height distinctions for some vowels in Twi. Twi has the weakest correlation between F1 and tongue root advancement, which suggests that the [ATR] contrast may involve additional strategies for pharyngeal cavity expansion that are not present in [TENSE] vowels. In doing so, we show that bilinguals produce similar contrasts in similar ways across their two languages, but that language-specific differences also persist, which may reflect different articulatory goals in each language.","tags":null,"title":"An acoustic-articulatory study of bilingual vowel production, Advanced tongue root vowels in Twi and tense-lax vowels in Ghanaian English","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous approaches to variation in second language users have either focussed on how variable production will eventually result in native-like `target' forms (Type 1 study), or have investigated the extent to which second language users reproduce patterns of variation similar to `native speakers' (Type 2 study). We additionally draw on sociocultural approaches to Second Language Acquisition and apply notions of accent aim, identity construction, and learning motivation in order to fully explore the data. In doing so, we advocate a `Type 3' approach to variation in second language users.","tags":null,"title":"Identity, accent aim, and motivation in second language users, New Scottish Gaelic speakers' use of phonetic variation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"19c53da3b95ea3e3f21b5e1c4b398812","permalink":"/publication/2015l/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015l/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates intonational variation and change in Scottish Gaelic (henceforth `Gaelic'), a minority endangered language undergoing revitalisation.

The young people are compared to older Gaelic-dominant speakers in Lewis. Results suggest a substantial difference in Gaelic prosodic structure between the older and younger speakers, with older speakers speaking Gaelic as a language with contrastive word accents (prosodically similar to Swedish), and young people speaking Gaelic as an intonation language (prosodically similar to English). Further analysis of the young people's intonation suggests cross-language influence from Glaswegian English on the realisation of pitch accents and boundary tones in Glasgow Gaelic. These results are discussed in terms of the impact of language contact and bilingualism on intonational structure, and language change in this context of minority language revitalisation.","tags":null,"title":"Intonational variation and change in Scottish Gaelic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Sam Kirkham","Eve Groarke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"774652745b3914393e95c510d8973dea","permalink":"/publication/2015icphs/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015icphs/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates intonational variation in Liverpool English, a dialect of British English that is recognised as having a number of distinctive phonetic characteristics.

Scottish Gaelic is described as having three phonemic laterals, which have previously been the subject of small-scale acoustic and static palatographic work. I expand on previous acoustic studies, including static and dynamic formant measures, and consider data from the diverse contemporary Gaelic-speaking population including [1] older speakers in a Gaelic- heartland area, [2] middle-aged speakers living in Glasgow, [3] adolescent speakers in immersion education in a heartland area, [4] adolescents in immersion education in Glasgow. Results suggest overall maintenance of the triple lateral system, but with substantial variation in the production of (phonemically) palatalised laterals in particular, which some young Glaswegians do not produce. These results are discussed with reference to language change in language revitalisation contexts, language contact, and modes of acquisition in revitalisation contexts.","tags":null,"title":"Phonetic variation in Scottish Gaelic laterals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"a4038d5901e8abbc4ca7934af0be1919","permalink":"/publication/2013thesis/","publishdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis examines language variation and change in a context of minority language revitalisation. In particular, I concentrate on young fluent speakers of Scottish Gaelic, a minority language of Scotland that is currently undergoing revitalisation. Data from three groups of speakers are presented, older speakers in the Isle of Lewis, a Gaelic heartland area in north-west Scotland, adolescent Gaelic-speakers in Lewis learning the language in immersion schooling; and adolescent Gaelic-speakers in immersion schooling in Glasgow, an urban centre where Gaelic has not traditionally been spoken as a widespread community language. The sociolinguistic analysis examines potential language changes, explores patterns of linguistic variation, and uncovers the role that Gaelic plays in identity formation for each of the participants. In order to gain an insight into the role of Gaelic in different speakers' lives, I report on ethnographic studies carried out in Lewis and in Glasgow. The phonetic analysis then explores patterns of variation in the production of laterals, vowels, and tone and intonation. The results indicate large differences between the speech of older and adolescent speakers in Lewis, while differences between young speakers in Lewis and Glasgow suggest that Glasgow Gaelic is developing as a phonetically and socially distinct variety of the language. For example, older speakers in Lewis speak Gaelic as a partial tone language, unlike young people in Lewis and in Glasgow. Differences are also present between young people in Lewis and in Glasgow, such as in vowel acoustics, the production of the lateral system, and intonation patterns. The developments detailed in this thesis are the result of a complex interaction between the internal sound structure of Gaelic, language contact with varieties of English, identity construction, and differing conceptions of the self. All of these factors are conditioned by the status of Gaelic as a minority endangered and revitalised language. In exploring these avenues, I advance an account of language variation and change and apply it to a context of minority language revitalisation.","tags":null,"title":"Phonetic variation, sound change, and identity in Scottish Gaelic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance","Jane Stuart-Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"a06a6092802e090e1f65823760402de5","permalink":"/publication/2013jipa/","publishdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013jipa/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to describe pre-aspirated and post-aspirated stops in an endangered language, Scottish Gaelic. Our small-scale study investigates several acoustic parameters of Scottish Gaelic stop consonants designed to measure the duration and noisiness of aspiration of the stop in its immediate phonetic context. Our study expands on previous phonetic descriptions of phonemic (pre-)aspiration in three ways. Firstly, we provide a more complete durational description of Scottish Gaelic than previous work in the literature; secondly, we apply a new measure, band-pass filtered zero crossing rate (Gordeeva and Scobbie 2010), in order to examine the noisiness of aspiration in addition to durational characteristics. The results from this measure are presented in tandem with durational results in order to assess its usefulness for future research. Thirdly, we consider the possibility of change in the Scottish Gaelic stop system by examining data from older and younger speakers. Results suggest that band-pass filtered zero crossing rate is a useful tool and should be considered in future research on aspiration. Also, durational and zero crossing results indicate that younger speakers have shorter and less noisy pre-aspiration than older speakers. We discuss these results as a possible sound change in progress.","tags":null,"title":"Pre-aspiration and post-aspiration in Scottish Gaelic stop consonants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Nance"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1296518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1296518400,"objectID":"86f383aaacc6b55643a9cd3f7965471f","permalink":"/publication/2011icphs/","publishdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011icphs/","section":"publication","summary":"This study provides an acoustic phonetic analysis of some of the vowels in an endangered language with little phonetic documentation, Scottish Gaelic.
